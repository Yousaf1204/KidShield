## üöÄ Architecture Overview

KidShield is built using a modern hybrid architecture optimized for reliability and battery efficiency:

* **Persistent Foreground Service**
  Executes every 2 seconds to check if the currently active app is in the blocked list and takes immediate action.

* **AlarmManager for Periodic Sync**
  Handles heavier sync tasks (location, SMS, call logs) every 1-5 minutes for optimal power usage.
